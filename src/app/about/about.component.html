      <h1>We care a lot about computing, and we care a lot about equity. </h1>
      <p>That’s why we we created Classroot, a web application to help teachers make their CS classrooms as inclusive as possible.</p>

      <p>Research shows that stereotypically “tech-bro” classrooms make girls less likely to take
        computer science courses. Simple changes can, well, change this. We help teachers assess their environments and take simple steps to improve.</p>

      <p>We’re ready to grow — are you?</p>
